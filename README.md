# Behavioural Cloning

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

The goals of this project were the following:

* Generate and augment a behavioural cloning dataset by driving in a simulator.
* Build a deep-learning end-to-end driving model that predicts driving actions from camera data.
* Test, train and validate the model using the simulator driving data.
* Apply the model in the simulator, recording a video of the completion of one lap of the track.
